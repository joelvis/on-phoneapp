# Vault PDF Scanning & Export Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **PDF Display in Grid/List Views**
- **Problem**: PDFs were trying to load as images, causing black screens or failures
- **Solution**: Added `loadThumbnail(for:)` method that detects document type and renders PDF first page as thumbnail
- **Result**: PDFs now display properly in both grid and list views with a red "PDF" badge

### 2. **Multi-Page PDF Viewing**
- **Problem**: No way to view all pages of a multi-page scanned document
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `PDFPreviewView` component with page navigation in detail view
  - Created `PDFViewerView` full-screen viewer with swipeable pages
  - Added "View All Pages" button for multi-page PDFs
- **Result**: Users can now navigate through all pages and view them in a full-screen viewer

### 3. **Export/Share Functionality**
- **Problem**: 
  - Black screen on export
  - PDFs exporting as PNG instead of PDF
  - Share sheet unreliable
- **Solution**:
  - Completely rewrote `prepareForSharing()` method
  - PDFs now create temporary `.pdf` files for sharing
  - Images create temporary `.jpg` files for sharing
  - Proper error handling and file creation
- **Result**: Export now works correctly, PDFs export as PDFs, images as JPGs

### 4. **Document Scanning**
- **Status**: Already working correctly!
- The document scanner was already capturing multiple pages
- Now properly saves them as multi-page PDF documents
- Each page is viewable in the vault

## New Features Added

### PDF Preview Component
- Shows current page with navigation controls
- Displays total page count
- "View All Pages" button for full-screen viewing
- Maintains proper aspect ratio

### Full PDF Viewer
- Swipeable page-by-page navigation
- Zoom and pan support (via ScrollView)
- Page counter in toolbar
- Loading indicator while rendering pages
- Works with any number of pages

### Smart Thumbnail Loading
- Automatically detects document type (PDF vs Image)
- Renders PDF first page at optimal resolution
- Caches for performance
- Falls back to appropriate icon if loading fails

## Technical Improvements

### VaultStorageManager Enhancements
```swift
// New method that handles both PDFs and images
func loadThumbnail(for item: VaultItem) -> UIImage?

// Renders first page of PDF as thumbnail
func renderPDFThumbnail(filename: String) -> UIImage?
```

### Share Functionality
- Creates temporary files in system temp directory
- Proper file naming with document title
- Atomic writes for reliability
- Cleans up automatically (iOS handles temp cleanup)

### PDF Rendering
- Uses Core Graphics PDF APIs
- Efficient page-by-page rendering
- Background thread for multi-page loading
- Proper memory management

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Scan a multi-page document**
   - Open Vault
   - Tap "+" → "Scan Document"
   - Scan multiple pages
   - Add title and save
   - Verify PDF badge appears in grid/list view

✅ **View PDF pages**
   - Tap on a PDF document
   - Navigate between pages using arrow buttons
   - Tap "View All Pages" for full viewer
   - Swipe between pages

✅ **Export PDF**
   - Open a PDF document
   - Tap share button (top right)
   - Share to Files, Mail, Messages, etc.
   - Verify it exports as .pdf file

✅ **Export Image**
   - Open an image document
   - Tap share button
   - Verify it exports as .jpg file

## Files Modified

- `VaultView.swift`:
  - Added `loadThumbnail(for:)` method (line ~907)
  - Added `renderPDFThumbnail(filename:)` method (line ~919)
  - Added `PDFPreviewView` component (line ~1749)
  - Added `PDFViewerView` component (line ~1876)
  - Updated `VaultItemDetailView` (line ~1985)
  - Updated `VaultItemGridCard` (line ~2511)
  - Updated `VaultItemListRow` (line ~2587)

## Known Behaviors

1. **First Load**: PDF thumbnails may take a moment to render on first view (encrypted, decrypted, then rendered)
2. **Large PDFs**: Multi-page PDFs with many pages will show loading indicator while rendering all pages
3. **Temp Files**: Share creates temporary files that iOS cleans up automatically
4. **Encryption**: All PDFs remain encrypted on disk, only decrypted in memory for viewing

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- Add PDF search functionality
- Add annotation support
- Add PDF compression options
- Add page reordering in multi-page PDFs
- Add OCR for all pages (currently only first page)
