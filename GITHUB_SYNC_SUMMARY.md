## What Was Merged

### File Sharing Fix Details

**Issue:** Share sheet was showing white/blank screen instead of iOS share options

**Solution:** Improved UIActivityViewController presentation using `ShareSheetContainer`

**Changes in VaultView.swift:**
- Updated `ShareSheet` UIViewControllerRepresentable
- Added `ShareSheetContainer` class that properly manages presentation
- UIActivityViewController now shows in `viewDidAppear`
- Includes guard check to prevent duplicate presentations

**Code:**
```swift
class ShareSheetContainer: UIViewController {
    let items: [Any]

    init(items: [Any]) {
        self.items = items
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    }

    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)
        
        // Only present if not already presenting
        if presentedViewController == nil {
            let activityVC = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: items, applicationActivities: nil)
            present(activityVC, animated: true)
        }
    }
}
```
